# Cardify
Markdown is widely used by productivity and notetaking apps---Obsidian, Joplin, Text Edit. It is also a convenient way to visualize information offline and which can easily be read offline. The trouble, however, with taking offline notes is that they are not backed up; offline notes aren't searchable; they can't be easily updated. On the other hand, taking notes digitally sometimes involves distracting apps or too much friction to use, or risk being out of sight and therefore out of mind. 

In other words, there isn't a perfect system for making small, atomic notes on index cards that are also updateable, searchable, and digitally stored---and which allows you to have physical copies of each note.

## Features:

- Make markdown files that can be easily exported to any app (Obsidian, Logseq, text edit)
- Add lists, bold, italics, etc.
- add tags
- Easily make a PDF copy of your card
- Easily print index card copies for offline storage and use


My system is based on Robert Greene's method of note taking: reading a book, making marginalia, and using it when writing later on. This is system is incredibly useful for informing your writing with accessible research. He writes his notecards by hand and does not keep a digital copy. However, my method starts with using Cardify to make the note and the ability to print it for offline use. If you would like to make digital copies of your research while having printed copies for reference while writing, then this app is for you! I suspect most of us prefer something physical over the digital, intagible. Evolutionary psychologist Dan Lieberman refers to this primal desire amid a modern world as "caveman syndrome." We like the smell and texture of physical books over the dry experience of reading digital ones.

This app bridges the gap between physical notes and digital search, backup, and storage. Keeping ditigal and physical index cards is wonderful because you can write notes in a minimalist, distraction-free app, print copies, and keep copies online. This app conveniently shows you how much text is on your index card, keeping your notes atomic. There is also room for #'s for you to tag and categorize your cards. If you use Obsidian (or an open-source alternative), you can easily find themes in your research.
